A little [BrainFuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) interpreter implementation written in C (C89)
that targets *all of the platforms* (works on dos!).

Right now it is capable of running BrainFuck from both a file (no heap allocation!),
and from a string.

The code should also be seperated into multiple files because it's currently
really hard to work with everything in one file.

Features I want to implement:
* Better command line option handling
* REPL
* Other things probably?
